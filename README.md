# UCLA Library Design Tokens

Design tokens for UCLA Library.

The **Design Tokens** repository stores and syncs design tokens from the UCLA Library Design System using the [Figma Tokens plugin](https://docs.tokens.studio/) and GitHub Actions to generate Sass variables for use. 

## What are Design Tokens?

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development. - [Salesforce UX](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/)

## Requirements
This package requires [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) because [LibSass is deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated). If you are using the [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) package in your project (which provides the Node.js binding to the deprecated LibSass), please replace it with the [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) package:
```
npm uninstall node-sass && npm install sass --save-dev
```

## Usage
Install the package:
```
npm install ucla-library-design-tokens --save-dev
```
Then in your Sass, load the module (e.g., variables, typography, or helpers):
```
@import "~ucla-library-design-tokens/scss/variables.scss";
@import "~ucla-library-design-tokens/scss/helpers.scss";
@import "~ucla-library-design-tokens/scss/typography.scss";
```
Then in your component, include the desired mixin:
```
.category {
  @include overline;
}
```
or, include the desired variable:
```
.category {
  margin-bottom: $component-06 + px;
}
```
or, include the desired SVG if using vue-svg-loader:
```
import SvgHatchRight from "~/node_modules/ucla-library-design-tokens/assets/svgs/graphic-hatch-lines"
```
## Files

- `scss/*` - Tokens usable by developers
- `assets/*` - Assets usable by developers

## Best Practices

Helpful reminders to future selves:
- Use the commit message conventions that trigger [semantic releases](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/support/faq#how-can-i-change-the-type-of-commits-that-trigger-a-release)
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - perf: A code change that improves performance
  - test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
  - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- Always leave a comment when creating, reviewing, and merging a pull request
